# Welcome to your coursework planner

This is how you will plan and manage your coursework at CYF. You will add all your work as issues to your fork of this repository, and then use a [project board](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Coursework-Planner/projects?query=is%3Aopen) to manage your work. This is broadly how all technical projects are managed, so you will need lots of practice. Get started today.

## 1. How to get set up

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Coursework-Planner/) to your own GitHub
2. Turn on `issues` in the `settings`

You must fork to your personal Github account. Forks created in the CYF org will be deleted by a bot.

## 2. Every module, you will add your work as issues

Each module has a module repo. The coursework for each module is added as issues to that repository. All the module repos are listed in the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Table-of-Contents).

1. Go to the module repo
2. Click on the `Issues` tab
3. Copy each issue from the module repo to your own coursework repo.

We are building a tool to automate this process, but for now you will have to do it manually. We all use the [Kamino Clone Button](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kamino/ffdebockfdjileaojbbccofhgncmioaf?hl=en) Chrome extension to make this easier, so you could try that.

Note: If you are not able to clone repo issues. Then go to token settings -> repository permissions -> set `Administration - Access: Read and write` `issues - Access: Read-only` and `Metadata - Access: Read-only`.

Copy issues for each week or at most for each module. The coursework content is updated frequently, you will not have the most up to date tasks on your board if you copy all modules at once.

## 3. Refine your tickets and add them to your project board

1. Copy the [example project board](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/Coursework-Planner/projects?query=is%3Aopen)
2. Link your new project board to your fork of this repo
3. Add your tickets to the project board, using the labels to help you assign the fields
4. Make your board public in the settings, so your mentors can see it

There are example project boards attached to each module, showing you ways you can use boards to manage your time, prioritise, scope, and track your work. You should use the _same project board_ all the way through the course, and add to it as you go. Learn as you go, and adapt your board as you learn.

You can, and should, also add your own tickets to the board. Just remember it's a public board, so don't add anything you don't want to share with your mentors.
